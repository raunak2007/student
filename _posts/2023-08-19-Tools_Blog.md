<h2 style="padding-left: 70px">Existing tools</h2>
<ul style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 80px"><b>GitHub</b>: I set up an account back in 2022 for my first hackathon and I've never looked back! From creating a website that takes users' favorite movies and TV shows and outputs personalized book recommendations for a innovation competition to creating an application that translates real-time human facial expressions to an emoji, I've been able to continuously update and commit my work to this online platform. With version control, I've been able to track changes with other contributors, merge code seemlessly, and resolve conflicts efficiently. With features such as issue tracking and pull requests, GitHub fosters a structured environment for collaboration, transparency, and overall development process. I really love how versatile it is in no matter what external coding medium you are using (Vscode, Xcode)</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 80px"><b>Visual Studio Code</b>: THE place to code. Here are 3 things I love about it: 
    <li>User-Friendly Interface: A straightforward environment to write and test code w/out overwhelming complexity. Really made it easy for me to start as a beginner!</li>
    <li>Interactive Learning: The vast array of extensions such as GitLens (info about code changes, commit history, and more), Bracket Pair Colorizer, Docker, HTML CSS Support, Docker, etc. avaliable directly within VS Code have been most helpful in supporting the learning process of my coding skills </li>
    <li>Real-Time Assistance: Features such as auto-completion, syntax highlights, and integrated error checking provide immediate feedback and assist young learners in identifying and rectifying mistakes as they code --- fostering a snese of accomplishment and self-reliance!</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 80px"><b>GitHub Pages</b>: Being able to showcase my projects and different websites! Notes on video - 
    <li>Version Control Cycle: Pull (bring code from cloud to local machine & necessary for sharing code), Push (Local save of files, track changes, COMMIT OFTEN), Push (Sync code from local to Github, allow others to access code)</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 80px"><b>Juypter Notebooks</b>: Focus on interactive data analysis & storytelling w/mix of code and visualization. Supports a bunch of lang & very useful for data science, ML, and research. Used it to pilot CNN algorithm & analyze gene pattern data. Notes on video - 
    <li>Composed of cells (markdown or code)</li>
    <li># to make comments </li>
    <li>Markdown: list, image, hyperlink</li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 80px"><b>Slack</b>: A semi-professional communication platform that allows for casual private messaging and group chats, but also more organized channels categorized by content such as announcement, general, questions, etc. I LOVE slack! 
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 80px"><b>Docker</b>: Create, distribute, and run applications inside isolated containers. Super amazing because it ensures that software runs consistently across different environments, like your laptop or a server, without worrying about differences in setups. This makes testing, deploying, and managing applications more reliable and efficient!
</ul>

<h2 style="padding-left: 70px">New tools</h2>
<ul style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 80px"><b>MacOS</b>: To be honest my old Windows computer just broke but I really love my new mac! Love the Unix-based environment and how it provides a smoother workflow for developers working alondside designers or on applications that require graphical interfaces. I'm able to do iOS development now!
</ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 80px"><b>Homebrew</b>: Package manager for MacOs. Simplifies the installation and management of software packages and libraries. It allows users to easily install, update, and manage various command-line tools and applications directly from the terminal.
</ul>
