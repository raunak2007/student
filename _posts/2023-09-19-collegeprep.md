- One way to get accepted for BIG CODE positions would be looking at big company websits & restyling them to fix any issues!!

<b>Reflection</b>
Overall, I really enjoyed listening in to this panel of experienced CS students. Since I plan to apply first-major as Computer Science to all of the UCs and a majority of private colleges, it felt very helpful to hear how these people a few years older than me have succeeded in a way I hope to succeed. The biggest takeaway I got was that once you choose the CS route you have to COMMIT to coding regularly, programming personal projects that genuinely excite you, and always seeking opportunities around you to further your skillset and resume for long-term career! I look forward to attending university where I can explore my interest in human-computer interactions and create user-friendly &  immersive interfaces that foster the connection between people and technology!
