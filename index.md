<h3 style="text-align: center; color: #e69138">ABOUT ME</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 300px; padding-right: 300px">Howdy! My name is Emma Shen and I'm a senior at Del Norte High. I'm interested in studying HCI and pursuing a career in UI/UX development. In my free time, I like playing tennis, listening to wave to earth, and exploring new food and pretty nature places in San Diego. My family & friends are the center of my life!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center; color: #e06666">ACADEMICS</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 420px; padding-right: 420px">
I love learning about <u>visual computing</u> and <u>cognitive perception</u> to investigate human behavior’s connection to digital interactions! I hope to perfect the craft of immersive interfaces 🧠 💻

I also have a non-career oriented fascination for <u>religious studies</u>! Inspired by my mother's Christian spiritual transformation, I hope to freely learn about other religious beliefs to examine how they influence their followers' perception of meaning in life 💭
